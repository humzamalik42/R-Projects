Overview

This R script provides a comprehensive introduction to the Tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. It is centered around a case study using the gapminder dataset to demonstrate various data manipulation techniques and visualization strategies.

Key Components of the Script

Data Manipulation

Filtering: The script showcases how to extract subsets of data from the gapminder dataset using conditions like year and country.

Arranging: Demonstrates sorting data in ascending or descending order based on variables like GDP per capita (gdpPercap).

Mutating: Adds or transforms variables within the dataset, such as calculating GDP by multiplying GDP per capita by population.

Data Visualization with ggplot2

Scatterplots: The script illustrates the creation of scatterplots to explore relationships between variables such as GDP per capita and life expectancy.

Log Scales: Implements log scales on the x-axis to handle wide distributions and make patterns more discernible.

Aesthetics: Enhances plots by adding aesthetics like color and size to represent additional variables such as continent and population.

Faceting: Uses faceting to generate multiple plots for each continent for comparative analysis.

Statistical Summarization

Summarize Verb: Aggregates data to calculate means and totals, such as the average life expectancy and total population in the year 2007.

Group By Verb: Organizes data into groups (e.g., by year and continent) to calculate summaries for each group.

Advanced Visualization

Line Plots: Used to visualize changes over time, displaying trends in life expectancy across different continents.

Bar Plots: Visualizes categorical data, showing mean life expectancy by continent.

Histograms: Used to display the frequency distribution of life expectancies in the year 2007.

Boxplots: Illustrates the distribution of life expectancy across continents, highlighting medians, quartiles, and outliers.
