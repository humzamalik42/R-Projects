Description for R Project: Recidivism Study Using Logistic Regression

Overview:
This project evaluates a recidivism prevention program through a comprehensive study using logistic regression in R. The dataset consists of convict data including employment status, prior convictions, education, and marital status, aimed at predicting the likelihood of re-arrest after release from prison.

Project Files:
Code.R: Contains the R script used for all data analysis, including logistic regression modeling, data visualization, and output generation.

arrest data -1.csv and arrest data 2.csv: These CSV files provide the raw data for the study, including detailed records of convicts followed for 52 weeks after their release. The data encompasses demographic information, financial aid status (fin), and subsequent arrest records.

Individual Assignment: A detailed report explaining the methodology, analysis results, and recommendations based on the logistic regression analysis. This document includes interpretation of correlation plots, logistic regression outputs, and metrics such as AUC and confusion matrices.

Task Details.docx: Describes the assignment requirements and expectations, highlighting the use of logistic regression, the requirement to split the data for training and validation, and the emphasis on clear communication of results.
